# PhotoExplorer
Shows Flickr photos based on location

It uses 2 endpoints: "flickr.photos.search" that can be run unauthorized and 
"flickr.photos.geo.photosForLocation" that requires OAuth 1.0 authorization.

You can choose location on map and then you can browse flickr photos based on chosen location.
